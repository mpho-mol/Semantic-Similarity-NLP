Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a branch of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on how computers and human language interact. The objective of NLP is to make it possible for computers to meaningfully comprehend, interpret, and produce human language. It entails the creation of algorithms, models, and processing and analysis tools for speech and text data. Semantic similarity is a measure of how conceptually or semantically similar two bits of text, such as words, phrases, sentences, or documents, are to one another. It focuses on the underlying meaning of the text as opposed to syntactic similarity, which takes into account the structural or grammatical components of language. The objective is to ascertain how closely connected the ideas or content in two texts are.

This task was completed using Python to build a system that tells the user what to watch based on the word vector similarity of the description. Firstly, the movies.txt was read in where each line is a description of the different movies. A function was created to return which movies a user would watch if they watch if they watched Planet Hulk. The function takes the description of the said movie as a parameter and returns the title of the most similar movies.
